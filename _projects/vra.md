VRA is an internal iPad application designed for visitor registration at Spectrum Global's co-working space. When a visitor registers, the app automatically sends an email notification to the host, alerting them of their guest's arrival via email.

###### Key Features
- Clean and intuitive registration form.
- Real-time employee and company database.
- Sends real-time updates to recipients upon visitor registration.

###### My Role in This Project
- Built the app using Swift and UIKit with a test drive approach.
- Implemented real-time data features using Firebase Realtime Database.
- Created email notification functionality with Node.js in Firebase Cloud Functions.
