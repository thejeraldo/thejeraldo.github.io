The Peregrine Electronic Flight Bag is an iPad application used by Etihad, Airberlin, AirSerbia, AirSeychelles and Alitalia. The app features a centralized library for pilots, cabin crews and flight dispatchers for syncing and reading documents and submitting forms. The app provides timely notifications and bulletin updates. The app can view PDFs, HTML packages, videos and office files. The app also contains tools for pilots such as weather widgets, unit converters, aviation conversion and decoder tools.

###### Key Features
